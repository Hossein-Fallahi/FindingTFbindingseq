# Finding conserved motifs in any sequence based on only the sequence itself and the binary status of the seq.  

Here I am trying to find which sequence feature is responsible for binding to specific TF.   
This work inspired by the work by :    

You only need two sets of input:  

1- a file conating the sequences on each line   
2- a lable file telling the status of the seq either 0/1

This will predict that if a sequence have a biinding site for a particular TF.
